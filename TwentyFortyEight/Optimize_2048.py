#  Description: This program runs tests to optimize the weights for the AI evaluation parameters
""" The original optimization program implements a straightforward grid search technique for tuning the heuristic
weights used by the greedy AI solver for 2048. In this approach, the algorithm begins with a base set of weights and
evaluates the AI's performance by running multiple gamesâ€”calculating the average score as the evaluation metric. It
then iteratively perturbs each weight individually by a small fixed step (both positively and negatively) and retests
the modified set. If any perturbation leads to an improvement in the average score, that set of weights is adopted as
the new best configuration. This process is repeated for all weights, and the final optimized set is saved to a results
file. While simple to implement, this method can be limited by its inability to escape local optima and by the fact
that it adjusts only one parameter at a time. """
