The optimizations to the Hard/Master bots in Connect Four represent a significant improvement in both performance and
strategic play. The most substantial changes include consolidating redundant code by merging the check_win() and
check_win_for_player() functions into a unified system with check_win_for_position(), which streamlines win detection
across the codebase. The implementation now features dynamic search depth adjustment based on the game phase, allowing
for shallower searches in early positions (depth 4 for early game) and deeper analysis in critical late-game scenarios
(full depth 4/6 depending on difficulty level). The memoization system was enhanced with a more efficient
Zobrist-inspired hashing approach that reduces memory usage while still preventing redundant calculations, and is
selectively applied only to shallow depths (â‰¤2) where it provides the most benefit.

Strategic improvements include sophisticated column ordering that prioritizes center and adjacent columns with
different weights depending on game phase, which significantly improves alpha-beta pruning efficiency. The AI now
detects and responds to two-move win scenarios (unblockable forks) for both offense and defense through the
consolidated simulate_move() function that handles both immediate win detection and fork detection with a single
mechanism. Additionally, the evaluation function was refined with position-based weighting that favors lower rows,
providing the AI with a better understanding of Connect Four fundamentals where controlling the bottom positions is
strategically advantageous. These changes collectively result in an AI that plays stronger moves while using
computational resources more efficiently, particularly in the Master difficulty where the strategic pattern recognition
and variable-depth search allow it to find winning combinations.
